Password generator designed using Python

The Tkinter module has been used to create a User Interface. 
The user is required to input the required password length(8 to 20 characters).
The generate button generates a random password and there is an option to regenerate the password.
The password can be regenerated any number of times.
There is also a copy button which can be used to copy the password to the clipboard.
The password is a combination of numbers, symbols, capital and small letters.
